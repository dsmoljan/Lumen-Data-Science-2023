\newchapter{Introduction}{ch:introduction}

In this documentation, we will present our solution for the Lumen DataScience 2023 competition on the subject of instrument and voice detection in audio. 

First, a short motivation behind tackling this problem is given, as well as the potential applications of our solution alongside an overview of the existing approaches. Then, we provide an in-depth analysis of the data made available to us, as well as all the steps taken to prepare the data for use in model training. In the \textit{Modeling} section, we present the machine learning models that present the backbone of our solution and evaluate them in the \textit{Evaluation} section. To conclude, we provide a discussion on the overall performance of our models  and give possible ideas for further improvement. \clearpage
